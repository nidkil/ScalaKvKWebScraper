ScalaKvKWebScraper
==================

This is a service implemented in Scala that provides an API to retrieve information about organizations from the website of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KvK) in a structured way. It uses web scraping to extract the organization information from the search functionality of the KvK website and return it as structured JSON. This makes it easy to integrate this information in applications, services or scripts. The implementation supports both REST and CLI interfaces. This provides maximum flexibility integrating in applications, services and scripts.

Disclaimer / notes of caution
==================

I have just started programming in Scala. For a previous project I implemented similar functionality using Java. I thought it would be a good exercise to reimplement it using Scala.

If you have any suggestions or improvements please let me know.

This code has only been test with Scala version 2.11.2.
