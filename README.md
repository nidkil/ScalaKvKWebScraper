ScalaKvKWebScraper
==================

This is a service implemented in Scala that provides an api to search for organisations in the database of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KvK). It uses web scraping to extract the information from the search functionality of the KvK website and return it as structured JSON. This makes it easy to integrate the information in applications, services or scripts. The implementation provides both a REST and CLI interface. This provides maximum flexibility integrating in applications, services and scripts.
